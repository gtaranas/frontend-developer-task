# üß™ User Profile Dashboard Task

Welcome! This is a real-time coding task designed to simulate a day-one feature request in our team. Your goal is to complete and improve a partially implemented React + TypeScript component.

---

## üéØ Your Mission

You have just joined the team. A teammate left a partially done `UserProfile` component. Your task:

1. **Complete the user profile layout** using the data from this API:
   - `https://reqres.in/api/users/2`
2. **Implement loading and error states** (basic version is already started).
3. **Fix a responsiveness issue** so the layout works well on mobile and desktop.
4. **Enhance the UI** with any details you think are useful (e.g. registration date, alerts, formatting).
5. **Refactor or improve code quality** where needed (naming, props, typing, etc.).

## üîÅ Mid-Test Change (To Be Simulated)

> During the session, you may receive an update or change request from the "team." Be ready to adapt your code accordingly.
